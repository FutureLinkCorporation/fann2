fann2
=====

Python bindings for Fast Artificial Neural Networks 2.2.0 (FANN >= 2.2.0). These
are the original python bindings included with FANN 2.1.0 beta and updated to
include support for python 2.6-3.4.


DESCRIPTION
===========

This is a python binding for Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (FANN >=
2.2.0) that implements multi-layer artificial neural networks with support for
both fully-connected and sparsely-connected networks. It includes a framework
for easily handling training data sets. It is easy to use, versatile, well-
documented, and fast.

pkgin -y install py-fann2


USAGE
=====
Just 


    >> from fann2 import libfann 


and then create libfann.neural_net and libfann.training_data objects


    >> ann = libfann.neural_net()
    
    >> train_data = libfann.training_data()


Look at the examples in the FANN documentation and its C++ bindings for further
reference.
